# About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Marketing Group at University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I recently completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Zurich.

My current research leverages text as data, utilizing tools from Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, integrating their outputs into quantitative models to understand:

* The impact of social media content on consumer demand for new products
* The interaction between offline advertising and online word of mouth
* How the structure of online networks influence the spread of information and decision making

<strong style="color: red;">I'm on the job market</strong>. I will be available for interviews at the AMA Summer Academic Meeting in Chicago from August 9 - 11.

* My CV can be downloaded [here](files/lachlandeer-cv.pdf).
