abstract = "Building product buzz, defined as emotion, energy, excitement, or anticipation expressed by consumers about a product, has become an essential part of modern marketing practice surrounding the launch of new products. Despite its perceived importance, there is limited work that has tried to quantify product buzz around a product's impending release. This paper develops a machine learning algorithm to quantify product buzz and track its evolution over time using social media data about new release movies from Twitter. The proposed algorithm proceeds in three steps: First, the algorithm classifies a tweet into one of three categories, consumer buzz, consumer review or firm generated content, based on a tweet's text and author. Second, the text of tweets that are classified as consumer buzz is analysed to measure emotion and anticipation. Third, the algorithm combines the volume of tweets, the emotions expressed within them and their dynamic properties to compute a measure of product buzz that updates daily. The results are among the first to provide a quantitative assessment of product buzz using the volume and content of social media data."
