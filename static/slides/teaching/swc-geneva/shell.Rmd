# Learning Objectives

* **Goal:** gain familiarity with a 'reproducible' computational workflow 
    * How?: *hands-on* workshop
    * Coverage:
        * the Unix Shell: text based instructions
        * Git: Version control
        * Python

* *We don't expect you to have any computational experience before we start*
    * By the end we want you to be able to:
        1. work with data in Python (summary/group statistics, plotting) ...
        2. ... in a way that is reproducible by yourself and others
    * My number one coding tip:
        * Don't focus on the syntax, but on the way we think
            * you can google the syntax, hard to google how we think

# Learning Environment

* I like learning environments that are *relaxed*, but *focussed*
    * Communicate as peers, there's no hierachy in this room

* Feel free to:
    * Interupt and ask questions
    * Share relevant experiences
    * Let us know when something isn't working for you

# Exercise: relative path resolution
Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`, what will `ls -F ../backup display`?

1. `../backup: No such file or directory`
2. `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
3. `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
4. `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`

# Exercise: Renaming Files
Suppose that you created a .txt file in your current directory to contain a list of the statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: statstics.txt

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`

---
# Exercise: Moving and Copying
What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ pwd
/Users/jamie/data
$ ls
proteins.dat
$ mkdir recombine
$ mv proteins.dat recombine
$ cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
$ ls
```
1. `proteins-saved.dat recombine`
2. `recombine`
3. `proteins.dat recombine`
4. `proteins-saved.dat`

# Exercise: Copying Structure, without files
You’re starting a new experiment, and would like to duplicate the file structure from your previous experiment without the data files so you can add new data.

Assume that the file structure is in a folder called ‘2016-05-18-data’, which contains a data folder that in turn contains folders named `raw` and `processed` that contain data files. The goal is to copy the file structure of the `2016-05-18-data` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20-data` and remove the data files from the directory you just created.

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do?

---
# Exercise: Copying Structure, without files (cont.)

Option One:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ cp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-05-20-data/
$ rm 2016-05-20-data/raw/*
$ rm 2016-05-20-data/processed/*
```
Option 2:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ rm 2016-05-20-data/raw/*
$ rm 2016-05-20-data/processed/*
$ cp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-5-20-data/
```
Option 3:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ cp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-05-20-data/
$ rm -r -i 2016-05-20-data/
```

# Exercise: Piping Commands Together

In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of lines. Which command listed below would work?

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3
wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3
wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n
wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3
```

---
# Exercise: Which pipe?
The file `animals.txt` contains 586 lines of data formatted as follows:
```
2012-11-05,deer
2012-11-05,rabbit
2012-11-05,raccoon
2012-11-06,rabbit
...
```
Assuming your current directory is `data-shell/data/`, what command would you use to produce a table that shows the total count of each type of animal in the file?

1. `grep {deer, rabbit, raccoon, deer, fox, bear} animals.txt | wc -l`
2. `sort animals.txt | uniq -c`
3. `sort -t, -k2,2 animals.txt | uniq -c`
4. `cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | uniq -c`
5. `cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c`
6. `cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l`

# Exercise: Saving Files in a loop
In the same directory, what is the effect of this loop?
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
for alkanes in *.pdb
do
    echo $alkanes
    cat $alkanes > alkanes.pdb
done
```
What if we replace `>` with `>>`?

# Exercise: Doing a Dry Run

A loop is a way to do many things at once — or to make many mistakes at once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop would do is to echo the commands it would run instead of actually running them.

Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute without actually running those commands:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
for file in *.pdb
do
  analyze $file > analyzed-$file
done
```
What is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we want to run?

---
# Exercise: Doing a Dry Run (cont.)
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Version 1
for file in *.pdb
do
  echo analyze $file > analyzed-$file
done
```
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Version 2
for file in *.pdb
do
  echo "analyze $file > analyzed-$file"
done
```

# Exercise: Script to List Unique Species
Leah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this:
```
2013-11-05,deer,5
2013-11-05,rabbit,22
2013-11-05,raccoon,7
2013-11-06,rabbit,19
2013-11-06,deer,2
2013-11-06,fox,1
2013-11-07,rabbit,18
2013-11-07,bear,1
```
An example of this type of file is given in `data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt`.

Write a shell script called `species.sh` that takes any number of filenames as command-line arguments, and uses `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of those files separately.

---
# Exercise: Debugging Scripts
Suppose you have saved the following script in a file called do-errors.sh in Nelle’s north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Calculate stats for data files.
for datafile in "$@"
do
    echo $datfile
    bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile
done
```
When you run it:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ bash do-errors.sh NENE*[AB].txt
```
the output is blank. To figure out why, re-run the script using the -x option:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash -x do-errors.sh NENE*[AB].txt
```
What is the output showing you? Which line is responsible for the error?
